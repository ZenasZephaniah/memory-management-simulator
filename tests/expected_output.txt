CORRECTNESS CRITERIA:

1. Allocation Strategy (First Fit):
   - When 'malloc 16' is called after 'free 2', the allocator MUST fill the hole left by block 2 first, rather than appending to the end of memory.

2. Coalescing:
   - When 'free 1' and 'free 3' are called, the log must show "Merged with neighbor" messages, indicating that adjacent free blocks were combined.

3. Cache Simulation:
   - First access to an address should show "L1 MISS -> L2 MISS".
   - Subsequent accesses to the same address (or nearby offsets) should show "L1 HIT".
